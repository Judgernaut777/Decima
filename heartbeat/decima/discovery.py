"""Tool-DISCOVERY + a deterministic semantic/vector index over capabilities.

Policy — PLUG-IN-OR-FORGE, in strict order:
  1. Find an EXISTING capability that fits the goal (rank the manifest registry by
     semantic similarity — the `manifest.py` catalog is the searchable surface).
  2. If nothing in the registry clears the bar, optionally consult a `research` seam
     (an injected callable that returns candidate tool descriptors from the web /
     external registries / an MCP index) — plug one in rather than reinvent it.
  3. Only if BOTH miss, signal Nona to FORGE a new capability. Forging is the last
     resort, never the first move — this is what makes the built-in research/discovery
     function load-bearing.

The "vector embeddings" projection over capabilities (Method's data architecture) is
implemented here as a DETERMINISTIC LEXICAL EMBEDDING: tokenize → hash each token to a
dimension (BLAKE2b mod N) → an integer bag-of-words vector. It is NOT a real ML model —
it is a stdlib stand-in that occupies the exact seam where a real embedder wraps later
(swap `embed`/`similarity`, keep `search`/`discover`). Everything recorded is an INT:
no float ever enters a score. Same inputs → same vector → same ranking, forever.

Pure stdlib. Composes public `manifest`/`hashing`/`kernel` APIs only — no core edit.
